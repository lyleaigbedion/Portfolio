excerpt: Data Visualization App Using Spotify's Web API.
---

Hi all! This is [ekoPique](https://ekopique.herokuapp.com/), a data visualization app using Spotify's web api and the highlight of my bootcamp experience. This project was the hard work of Ube Halaya, Osainu Jabbi, and myself with guidance from Manny Garcia and Natlie Lane. This was completed over the course of 2 and half weeks.

We started our project with the question "Well, what do we want to do?". We spent most of the day coming up with ideas, getting a feel for each other's interests and personalities. We finally decided on data vizualization. Data Viz was now the goal but what we wanted to vizualize was yet another question . At first it was COVID-19, we quickly realized *As soon as it was said* that the topic was too heavy to engage with on a day to day basis. We want light hearted fun, something users could find to distract themselves even for a moment. Ube recommended Spotify Wrapped, an end of year thing Spotify does to expose users of their unfaltering love of Talyor Swift ðŸ‘€. So with this idea we decided we'd begin our using Spotify as our data source.

We were going to need a FullStack Application to vizualze our goal:
  - A Database to store users and data.
  - A Server Framework to handle user requests and Spotify API calls.
  - Make it a Single Page Application (SPA).
  - Have a state manager.
  - Have a data vizualizing library to create graphs.


It doesn't look like much but the work and effort was immense!
