This is an Ecommerce site that follows the CRUD principles [gamesshopper.herokuapp.com](https://gamesshopper.herokuapp.com).

This project's tech stack includes: Node, React, Redux, Postgresql, and Express.

This project was not completed to the standards that my team and I set out to accomplish.
However, from it's failings I learned so much about myself, what I want out of a team and how to keep myself and others accountable, and to communicate always.
